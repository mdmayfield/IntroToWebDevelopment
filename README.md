# IntroToWebDevelopment

Completed assignments for Software Guild's Intro to Web Development.

## 1. Lucky Sevens

I made two versions of this:

* Simple version, following the assignment strictly / minimally
  * Playable online: https://mdmayfield.github.io/IntroToWebDevelopment/luckySevens-2d45063/luckySevens.html
  * Source code: https://github.com/mdmayfield/IntroToWebDevelopment/tree/2d45063a2b033d60e378df8a9bc15ea75d5904bb
    * If cloning from Git, checkout 2d45063

* Enhanced version, with extra animation via more JavaScript
  * Playable online: https://mdmayfield.github.io/IntroToWebDevelopment/luckySevens.html
  * Source code: https://github.com/mdmayfield/IntroToWebDevelopment
  * Commit history: https://github.com/mdmayfield/IntroToWebDevelopment/commits/master

## 2.Restaurant Site

* Viewable online: https://mdmayfield.github.io/restaurant-site-3/index.html
* Source code: https://github.com/mdmayfield/restaurant-site-3
* Commit history: https://github.com/mdmayfield/restaurant-site-3/commits/master

* Notes:
  * Bootstrap 4 no longer includes the type of form validation done in Click To Add Items (which used Bootstrap 3)
  * HTML5 form validation can automatically enforce type="email" and other required fields via regex
  * However, to fit the assignment criteria, I used manual JS form validation similar to Click To Add Items
  * Since Bootstrap removed the has-error class, I used setCustomValidity() instead

Thank you!
