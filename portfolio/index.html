        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

        <p>This is a paragraph of text - not only in a grammatical and semantic sense, as in a human being reading this views it as a <strong>collection of sentences all about the same topic</strong>; but also in a markup sense. That is, all the words in this paragraph are enclosed by a &lt;p&gt; element. Those are just two of the theoretically infinite ways that this could be considered a paragraph of text.</p>
        <p>Lauren Ipsum doled out <span style="background-color: green; color: white; border: thick solid beige">sour cream</span><!--There should be a CSS standard color named "cream"--> to her customer, then decided to sit with Amet. He'd been working at Lauren's food truck for just over a month, but she had never actually spoken with him more than a few pleasantries at the beginning and end of shifts. But today he had done her an enormous favor: he located her missing pet rabbit, who had been hiding in the crisper drawer, gorging on lettuce and carrots.</p>

        <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>

        <p>The past is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift; that is why we call it the present.</p>

        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>

        <p>Taking a page from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Watterson" target="_blank">Bill Watterson</a>, I enjoy Calvin's hobbies: sledding, being a smart aleck on written tests, imagining silly things, and transmogrification.</p>
        <p>Time travel, photography, and solving mysteries are some other strange lifelong hobbies. Also mechanical engineering - <i>someone</i> has to fix that problem with the trolley.</p>
