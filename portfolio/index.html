    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text - not only in a grammatical and semantic sense, as in a human being reading this views it as a collection of sentences all about the same topic; but also in a markup sense. That is, all the words in this paragraph are enclosed by a &lt;p&gt; element. Those are just two of the theoretically infinite ways that this could be considered a paragraph of text.</p>
    <p>Lauren Ipsum doled out sour cream to her customer, then decided to sit with Amet. He'd been working at Lauren's food truck for just over a month, but she had never actually spoken with him more than a few pleasantries at the beginning and end of shifts. But today he had done her an enormous favor: he located her missing pet rabbit, who had been hiding in the crisper drawer, gorging on lettuce and carrots.</p>
    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
    <p>The past is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift; that is why we call it the present.</p>

    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
    <p>Taking a page from Bill Watterson, I enjoy Calvin's hobbies: sledding, being a smart aleck on written tests, imagining silly things, and transmogrification.</p>
    <p>Time travel, photography, and solving mysteries are some other strange lifelong hobbies. Also mechanical engineering - <i>someone</i> has to fix that problem with the trolley.</p>
